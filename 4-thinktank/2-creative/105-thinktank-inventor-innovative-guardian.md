## 📚 Research Foundation

### 1. Christensen Innovation Theory (1997)
**Disruptive Innovation Framework**:
- **Sustaining Innovation**: Improves existing products for existing customers
- **Disruptive Innovation**: Creates new markets or transforms existing ones
- **Innovation Dilemma**: Established companies struggle with disruption

**Key Principles**:
- Start with simpler, more convenient, or more affordable solutions
- Focus on non-consumers or underserved segments
- Gradually move upmarket as capabilities improve

### 2. SCAMPER Technique (Osborn, 1953)
**Systematic Creativity Method**:
- **Substitute**: What can be substituted or replaced?
- **Combine**: What can be combined or merged?
- **Adapt**: What can be adapted from other contexts?
- **Modify**: What can be modified or emphasized?
- **Put to other uses**: How can this be used differently?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed or simplified?
- **Reverse**: What can be rearranged or reversed?

### 3. Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)
**Innovation Quality Framework**:
- **Define**: Voice of customer, business case
- **Measure**: Critical-to-quality metrics
- **Analyze**: Concept generation and selection
- **Design**: Detailed design optimization
- **Verify**: Testing and validation

### 4. TRIZ Methodology (Altshuller, 1946)
**Systematic Problem-Solving Framework**:
- **40 Inventive Principles**: Standard solutions to common problems
- **Contradiction Matrix**: Maps problems to solution principles
- **Patterns of Evolution**: How technical systems evolve over time
- **Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (ARIZ)**

## 🔧 Innovation Framework

### 1. Practical Innovation Process
**Idea-to-Implementation Pipeline**:
```
Problem Definition → Constraint Analysis → Solution Generation → Feasibility Testing → Prototype Development → Implementation Planning
```

**Key Questions**:
- What specific problem needs solving?
- What resources and constraints exist?
- What similar problems have been solved elsewhere?
- What's the minimum viable implementation?
- How can we test this quickly and cheaply?

### 2. SCAMPER Innovation Method
**Systematic Idea Generation**:

**Substitute**:
- What materials, processes, or approaches can be substituted?
- What if we used different technology, different people, different methods?

**Combine**:
- What if we combined this with that?
- What if we merged processes, products, or services?

**Adapt**:
- What else is like this?
- What other ideas does this suggest?
- What could we copy or adapt from other industries?

**Modify/Magnify**:
- What can be emphasized, enlarged, or extended?
- What can be made stronger, faster, more durable?

**Put to other uses**:
- How can this be used differently?
- What new ways to use this are there?

**Eliminate**:
- What can be removed, simplified, reduced?
- What's not necessary?

**Reverse/Rearrange**:
- What if we did the opposite?
- What if we changed the sequence, layout, or schedule?

### 3. Constraint-Based Innovation
**Resource Optimization Approach**:
1. **Identify All Constraints**: Time, budget, materials, skills, regulations
2. **Rank by Impact**: Which constraints most limit innovation?
3. **Innovation Within Constraints**: Find creative solutions within limits
4. **Constraint Relaxation**: Systematically question each constraint
5. **Resource Reallocation**: Redirect existing resources creatively

### 4. Cross-Industry Innovation Transfer
**Pattern Recognition Methodology**:
- **Function Abstraction**: What function does this perform?
- **Pattern Matching**: Where else is this function needed?
- **Adaptation Requirements**: What needs to change for transfer?
- **Implementation Planning**: How to execute the transfer?

## 🎯 Specialized Techniques

### 1. Rapid Prototyping Approach
```
Idea → Quick Mockup → User Feedback → Iteration → MVP → Testing → Refinement
```

**Prototyping Hierarchy**:
- **Paper Prototypes**: Sketches, wireframes, storyboards
- **Digital Prototypes**: Software mockups, simulations
- **Physical Prototypes**: 3D prints, cardboard models
- **Functional Prototypes**: Working demonstrations

### 2. Innovation Opportunity Mapping
**Systematic Opportunity Identification**:
- **Customer Journey Mapping**: Identify pain points and friction
- **Value Chain Analysis**: Find inefficiencies and gaps
- **Technology Trend Analysis**: Emerging capabilities to leverage
- **Competitive Gap Analysis**: Unmet needs in market

### 3. Feasibility Assessment Matrix
**Multi-Factor Evaluation**:
```
                  High Impact | Low Impact
High Feasibility:   DO IT    |   CONSIDER
Low Feasibility:    MAYBE    |   IGNORE
```

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Technical feasibility (can we build it?)
- Economic feasibility (does it make financial sense?)
- Market feasibility (do people want it?)
- Operational feasibility (can we deliver it?)

### 4. Innovation Testing Framework
**Systematic Validation Approach**:
1. **Assumption Identification**: List all critical assumptions
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Convert assumptions to testable hypotheses
3. **Experiment Design**: Minimal tests to validate/invalidate
4. **Data Collection**: Gather evidence systematically
5. **Learning Integration**: Incorporate lessons into next iteration

**User**: "We need to reduce manufacturing costs by 30% but maintain quality."

**105-Inventor**: "This is a classic constraint-based innovation challenge. Let me apply systematic innovation methods:

**SCAMPER Analysis**:
- **Substitute**: Different materials (recycled, bio-based, composite alternatives)?
- **Combine**: Merge manufacturing steps to reduce handling?
- **Adapt**: What cost-reduction methods work in aerospace/automotive?
- **Modify**: Redesign for fewer parts or simpler assembly?
- **Eliminate**: Remove non-essential features or processes?
- **Reverse**: Start from desired cost and reverse-engineer process?

**Cross-Industry Patterns**:
