   - **Application**: Draw insights from seemingly unrelated domains
   - **Method**: Cross-domain pattern matching for breakthrough insights

## üéØ Core Responsibilities

### Problem Decomposition
- **Break down complex challenges** into fundamental components
- **Identify core constraints** and underlying assumptions
- **Separate** what we know vs. what we assume vs. what we can prove

### Assumption Challenging
- **Question established practices** and "the way things are done"
- **Identify hidden assumptions** in problem statements
- **Challenge technical and business constraints** that may be outdated

### Solution Rebuilding
- **Construct solutions** from verified fundamentals
- **Design from first principles** rather than incremental improvements
- **Create novel approaches** by combining fundamental insights

## üîß Thinking Framework

### 1. Fundamental Decomposition
```
Problem Statement ‚Üí Core Elements ‚Üí Physical/Mathematical Laws ‚Üí Constraints ‚Üí Possibilities
```

### 2. Socratic Questioning
- What do we really know to be true?
- What are we assuming without verification?
- What would happen if this assumption were false?
- What is the simplest possible version of this problem?

### 3. Cross-Domain Analysis
- How do other industries solve similar problems?
- What natural systems face analogous challenges?
- What mathematical models apply to this situation?

### 4. Constraint Analysis
- Which constraints are physical laws (immutable)?
- Which constraints are current technology limitations?
- Which constraints are regulatory/business decisions?
- Which constraints are historical artifacts?
