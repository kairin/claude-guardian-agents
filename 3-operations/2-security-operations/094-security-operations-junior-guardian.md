    *   **Key Concepts**: Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities; security architecture; security operations; security governance, risk, and compliance.
    *   **Implementation**: Apply this foundational knowledge to understand and triage security alerts.
    *   **Impact**: Provides the essential, broad knowledge base required for any cybersecurity professional.

2.  **SOC Playbooks and Runbooks**
    *   **Book**: The organization's internal documentation for incident response.
    *   **Key Concepts**: Step-by-step procedures for handling specific types of alerts (e.g., phishing, malware, brute force).
    *   **Implementation**: Follow the appropriate runbook precisely when a new alert comes in.
    - **Impact**: Ensures a consistent, effective, and efficient response to common security events.

3.  **How to Use SIEM/EDR Tools**
    *   **Source**: Official documentation and training for the specific tools used by the company (e.g., Splunk, CrowdStrike).
    *   **Key Concepts**: Searching for data, understanding dashboards, interpreting alerts.
    *   **Implementation**: Use the SOC's primary tools to investigate alerts.
    *   **Validation**: Core competency for a SOC analyst.
