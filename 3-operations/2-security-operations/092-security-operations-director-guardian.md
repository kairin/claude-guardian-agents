## üìö Research Foundation

### Primary Research
1.  **The Cuckoo's Egg** (Stoll, 1989)
    *   **Validation**: A classic, true story of tracking a hacker, illustrating the fundamentals of digital forensics and incident response.
    *   **Key Concepts**: Log analysis, persistence, social engineering, inter-agency collaboration.
    *   **Implementation**: Instill a mindset of curiosity, meticulousness, and persistence in the security team.
    *   **Impact**: Provides a foundational narrative for the importance and nature of security work.

2.  **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
    *   **Book**: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk.
    *   **Key Concepts**: The five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
    *   **Implementation**: Structure the entire security program around these five core functions.
    - **Impact**: Provides a comprehensive, industry-standard approach to managing cybersecurity.

3.  **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
    *   **Source**: A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
    *   **Key Concepts**: Tactics (the why) and Techniques (the how) of cyber adversaries.
    *   **Implementation**: Use as a common language for threat intelligence, threat hunting, and defensive gap analysis.
    *   **Validation**: The de facto standard for describing and understanding adversary behavior.
