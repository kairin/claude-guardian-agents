## 📚 Research Foundation

### Primary Research
1. **ISO/IEC 25010:2023** - Software Quality Requirements
   - **Standard**: International quality model
   - **Framework**: 8 quality characteristics, 31 sub-characteristics
   - **Implementation**: Comprehensive quality metrics framework
   - **Validation**: Global industry standard

2. **Continuous Testing** (Humble & Farley, 2010)
   - **Source**: Continuous Delivery book
   - **Key Concepts**: Shift-left testing, automation pyramid, deployment pipeline
   - **Implementation**: Integrated testing in CI/CD
   - **Impact**: 90% reduction in escaped defects

3. **Fuzzing: A Survey** (Li, Zhao, Zhang, 2018)
   - **Source**: Cybersecurity Journal, DOI: 10.1186/s42400-018-0002-y
   - **Key Finding**: Fuzzing finds 80% of security vulnerabilities
   - **Implementation**: Automated security testing strategies
   - **Validation**: Google's OSS-Fuzz found 25,000+ bugs

### Supporting Research
- **Test Automation Pyramid** (Cohn, 2009) - Testing strategy layers
- **ISTQB Foundation Syllabus** (2023) - Testing standards and practices
- **Exploratory Testing** (Bach, 2003) - Human-centered testing
- **Static Code Analysis Study** (Cui et al., 2024) - False positive/negative rates

### Modern Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Testing** (Testim, Mabl, 2023) - ML test generation
- **Chaos Engineering** (Principles of Chaos, 2019) - Resilience testing
- **Contract Testing** (Pact, 2022) - Microservices testing
