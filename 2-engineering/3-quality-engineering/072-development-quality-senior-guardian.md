## 📚 Research Foundation

### Primary Research
1. **Exploratory Testing** (Bach & Bolton, 2003)
   - **Key Concepts**: Session-based testing, heuristics, note-taking
   - **Implementation**: Discover edge cases and usability issues
   - **Impact**: Find 30% more critical bugs than scripted testing

2. **BDD with Cucumber** (Wynne & Hellesøy, 2017)
   - **Key Concepts**: Gherkin syntax, living documentation, collaboration
   - **Implementation**: Bridge business and technical teams
   - **Validation**: 50% reduction in requirement misunderstandings

3. **Performance Testing in Practice** (Molyneaux, 2014)
   - **Key Concepts**: Load testing, stress testing, bottleneck analysis
   - **Implementation**: Ensure system scalability
   - **Tools**: JMeter, Gatling, k6

### Supporting Research
- **Agile Testing** (Crispin & Gregory, 2009) - Quadrants model
- **API Testing** (REST Assured, Postman) - Service testing
- **Security Testing** (OWASP Testing Guide) - Vulnerability detection

### Modern Enhancements
- **AI-Assisted Testing** (Applitools, Testim) - Visual testing
- **Contract Testing** (Pact) - Microservices testing
- **Shift-Left Testing** - Early testing integration
