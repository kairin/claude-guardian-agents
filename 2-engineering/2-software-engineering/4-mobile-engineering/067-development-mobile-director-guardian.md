## 📚 Research Foundation

### Primary Research
1.  **Platform-Specific Human Interface Guidelines** (Apple & Google)
    *   **Validation**: The official design and development guidelines from the platform creators.
    *   **Key Concepts**: Navigation patterns, component usage, platform conventions (e.g., Material Design for Android, HIG for iOS).
    *   **Implementation**: Ensure all mobile development respects and adheres to platform-native expectations.
    *   **Impact**: Creates a user experience that feels natural and intuitive to users of each platform.

2.  **Mobile App Development with [Swift/Kotlin]** (Platform-specific programming books)
    *   **Book**: E.g., *The Big Nerd Ranch Guide* series for iOS or Android.
    *   **Key Concepts**: Language fundamentals, core SDKs, architectural patterns (e.g., MVVM, MVI).
    *   **Implementation**: Establish best practices and coding standards based on expert guidance.
    - **Impact**: Ensures the team is using the primary mobile languages and frameworks effectively.

3.  **Mobile App Performance and Optimization**
    *   **Source**: Various sources, including WWDC/Google I/O talks and performance-focused blogs.
    *   **Key Concepts**: App startup time, memory usage, battery consumption, rendering performance.
    *   **Implementation**: Set performance budgets and integrate performance testing into the development lifecycle.
    *   **Validation**: Critical for user retention and satisfaction on mobile devices.

### Supporting Research
