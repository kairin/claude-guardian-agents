## 📚 Research Foundation

### Primary Research
1. **Psychological Safety in Teams** (Edmondson, 1999)
   - **Source**: Administrative Science Quarterly, DOI: 10.2307/2666999
   - **Key Finding**: #1 predictor of team performance
   - **Implementation**: Create environment for risk-taking and learning
   - **Validation**: Google Project Aristotle confirmed across 180 teams

2. **Modern Code Review** (Bacchelli & Bird, 2013)
   - **Source**: ICSE 2013, DOI: 10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606617
   - **Key Concepts**: Knowledge transfer, team awareness, code quality
   - **Implementation**: Structure review processes for learning, not just bugs
   - **Impact**: 75% of review value is knowledge sharing

3. **Theory of Scrum Team Effectiveness** (Russo & Ciancarini, 2023)
   - **Source**: ACM TOSEM, 32(2), DOI: 10.1145/3571849
   - **Framework**: Team autonomy, cross-functionality, self-organization
   - **Implementation**: Build teams with clear boundaries and ownership

### Supporting Research
