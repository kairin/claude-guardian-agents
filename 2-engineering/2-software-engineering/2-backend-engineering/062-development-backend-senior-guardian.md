   - **ISBN**: 978-0321146533
   - **Citations**: 5,000+ citations
   - **Key Concepts**: Red-green-refactor cycle, test-first design
   - **Implementation**: Write tests before code for all features
   - **Impact**: 40% reduction in defect density

2. **RESTful Web APIs** (Richardson & Ruby, 2013)
   - **Key Concepts**: REST constraints, HATEOAS, resource design
   - **Implementation**: Design scalable, maintainable APIs
   - **Validation**: Industry standard for web services

3. **Database Design for Mere Mortals** (Hernandez, 2013)
   - **Key Concepts**: Normalization, indexing, query optimization
   - **Implementation**: Efficient data modeling and access patterns
   - **Impact**: 10x query performance improvements

### Supporting Research
- **Effective Java** (Bloch, 2018, 3rd Ed) - Language best practices
- **Domain-Driven Design** (Evans, 2003) - Complex domain modeling
