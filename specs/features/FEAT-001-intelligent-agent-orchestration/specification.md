# FEAT-001: Intelligent Agent Orchestration Engine

## 🎯 Feature Overview

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Intelligent Agent Orchestration Engine
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Business Value**: Revolutionary improvement to user experience
**Effort Estimate**: 3-4 weeks
**Status**: Not Started

## 📋 Problem Statement

Current agent selection is manual and static:
- Users must know which specific agent to invoke (e.g., "use agent 062")
- No understanding of project context or task complexity
- No automatic workflow orchestration for multi-step tasks
- Cognitive load on users to understand agent capabilities

## 🎯 Solution Vision

Transform agent interaction from manual selection to intelligent orchestration:
```
BEFORE: "Use agent 062 for backend development"
AFTER:  "I need to implement user authentication" → AI automatically orchestrates
        strategy → architecture → backend → security → testing agents
```

### **Core Algorithms**

#### **1. Context Analysis Algorithm**
```python
def analyze_project_context(project_path: str) -> ProjectContext:
    """
    Analyzes project structure and extracts relevant context

    Returns:
        ProjectContext with:
        - project_type: "nodejs", "python", "rust", etc.
        - dependencies: List of detected dependencies
        - architecture: "monolith", "microservices", etc.
        - patterns: Detected architectural patterns
        - complexity: "simple", "moderate", "complex"
    """
    pass
```

#### **2. Agent Selection Algorithm**
```python
def select_optimal_agents(
    task_description: str,
    project_context: ProjectContext,
    user_preferences: UserPreferences
) -> List[AgentMatch]:
    """
    Selects optimal agents for a given task

    Scoring based on:
    - Agent capability match to task requirements (40%)
    - Project context compatibility (30%)
    - Historical performance (20%)
    - User preferences (10%)
    """
    pass
```

#### **3. Workflow Orchestration Algorithm**
```python
def orchestrate_workflow(
    agents: List[AgentMatch],
    task_context: TaskContext
) -> WorkflowPlan:
    """
    Creates optimal execution plan for multi-agent workflows

    Considers:
    - Agent dependencies and prerequisites
    - Parallel execution opportunities
    - Error handling and rollback strategies
    - Progress checkpoints and validation gates
    """
    pass
```
