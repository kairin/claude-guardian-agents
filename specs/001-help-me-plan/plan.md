## Summary
Comprehensive Guardian Agent specialization system with 40+ agents optimized for Claude Code's subagent chaining. Implements model optimization (22 Haiku agents for simple tasks, 28 Sonnet agents for complex reasoning), standardized documentation templates, workflow diagrams, and validation framework. Includes specialized Git workflow agents (101-112) with temporal tracking and performance SLAs.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Markdown documentation + YAML agent configuration
**Primary Dependencies**: Claude Code subagent system, Mermaid diagrams
**Storage**: Markdown files, YAML frontmatter, directory structure
**Testing**: Agent validation framework with ✓/☐/~/✗/⚠️ status tracking
**Target Platform**: Claude Code environment, cross-platform compatible
**Project Type**: Single project (documentation + agent template system)
**Performance Goals**: Haiku agents <2s response, Sonnet agents <10s response
**Constraints**: Maintain existing directory structure, 40+ agent coverage
**Scale/Scope**: 112 total agents (40 existing + 12 Git workflow + 60 specialized variants)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (documentation system with agent templates)
- Using framework directly? ✅ (Claude Code native subagent system)
- Single data model? ✅ (Guardian Agent entity model)
- Avoiding patterns? ✅ (Direct template application, no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**:

- Libraries listed: Guardian Agent templates, validation framework, workflow chains
- CLI per library: ✅ (Each agent accessible via Claude Code /task command)
- Library docs: ✅ (Standardized agent documentation with examples)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- Git commits show tests before implementation? ✅ (Validation checklists before agent updates)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✅ (Agent contracts → Chain integration → E2E workflows)
- Real dependencies used? ✅ (Actual Claude Code environment, real agent chaining)
- Integration tests for: ✅ (New agents, chain modifications, model optimization)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? ✅ (Agent performance metrics, validation reports)

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with existing directory organization maintained

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
*Status: Ready to execute*

### Unknowns to Research:
1. **Agent Specialization Patterns**: Best practices for distinguishing 40+ agents without overlap
2. **Model Optimization Strategies**: Optimal task assignment between Haiku and Sonnet models
3. **Validation Framework Design**: Implementation of ✓/☐/~/✗/⚠️ status tracking system
4. **Workflow Chain Optimization**: Performance optimization for agent-to-agent communication
5. **Git Workflow Integration**: Temporal tracking and branch management patterns

### Research Tasks Generated:
```
Task 1: "Research agent specialization patterns for avoiding capability overlap in 40+ AI agents"
Task 2: "Find best practices for Haiku vs Sonnet model assignment based on task complexity"
Task 3: "Research validation framework patterns for multi-perspective testing (development/testing/production)"
Task 4: "Find workflow optimization patterns for automated agent chaining in Claude Code"
Task 5: "Research Git workflow automation with timestamp-based branch naming and commit tracking"
```

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Design Approach:
1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Guardian Agent, Specialization Profile, Workflow Chain
   - Validation Framework, Performance SLA, Model Optimization Profile
   - Git Workflow Agent, Trigger Pattern, Agent Category

2. **Generate agent contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Agent YAML schema with validation rules
   - Workflow chain interface contracts
   - Model optimization configuration contracts

3. **Generate validation tests** from requirements:
   - Agent specialization uniqueness tests
   - Performance SLA compliance tests
   - Workflow chain integration tests

4. **Extract user scenarios** as quickstart guide:
   - Developer creates specialized agent
   - System optimizes model selection
   - Validation framework verifies agent quality

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
Based on Phase 1 design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/*, quickstart.md), the /tasks command will:

1. **Load Foundation**: Use `/templates/tasks-template.md` as structural base
2. **Extract from Contracts**: Generate validation tasks from agent-schema.yaml, workflow-chain-schema.yaml, validation-schema.yaml
3. **Extract from Data Model**: Create entity implementation tasks for Guardian Agent, Specialization Profile, Workflow Chain, etc.
4. **Extract from Quickstart**: Convert user scenarios into integration test tasks
5. **Generate Systematic Tasks**:
   - Template creation tasks (agent-file-template, validation-template, model-optimization-guide)
   - Existing agent update tasks for all 40+ agents using new template structure
   - New agent creation tasks for Git workflow agents (101-112)
   - Validation framework implementation (✓/☐/~/✗/⚠️ status tracking)
   - Model optimization configuration (Haiku/Sonnet routing)
   - Documentation standardization across all agent files

**Ordering Strategy** (TDD Constitutional Compliance):
1. **Foundation First**: Template creation and validation framework (tests before implementation)
2. **Contract Tests**: Generate failing tests from schema contracts
3. **Entity Tests**: Create data model validation tests
4. **Integration Tests**: User scenario validation from quickstart
5. **Implementation Tasks**: Make tests pass through agent updates and new agent creation
6. **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for independent agent file updates (no dependencies)
7. **Documentation Last**: Generate final documentation after all agents updated

**Estimated Task Breakdown** (45-50 total tasks):
- **Foundation (5 tasks)**: Templates, validation framework, test infrastructure
- **Contract Implementation (8 tasks)**: Schema validation, API contracts, test generation
- **Existing Agent Updates (25 tasks [P])**: Update all current agents with new template
- **New Git Agents (12 tasks [P])**: Create Git workflow agents 101-112
- **Integration & Testing (6 tasks)**: End-to-end workflows, performance validation
- **Documentation (4 tasks)**: Generate final docs, update registry, create examples

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- **TDD Order**: Tests written first for all new functionality
- **Library Pattern**: Each agent treated as standalone library component
- **Observability**: Performance metrics and validation logging built-in
- **Simplicity**: Avoid complex patterns, use direct template application

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan. All artifacts from Phase 1 (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) provide the input for systematic task generation.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run validation framework, verify agent performance, test workflow chains)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
