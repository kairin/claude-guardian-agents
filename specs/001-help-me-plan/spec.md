# Feature Specification: Guardian Agent Specialization & Documentation Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-help-me-plan`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "help me plan and update each of the md files within this repo to reflect each specific agentic behaviour of a subagent to make it highly specialised. take reference from existing documentation with the goal that each subagent specialisation can lead to optimisation in how we develop apps in general."

**Additional Requirements**: Git workflow agent specialization with model optimization:
- Simple tasks (branch naming, commit formatting) ‚Üí Haiku models for speed
- Complex decisions (merge strategies, session management) ‚Üí Sonnet models for reasoning
- Specialized Git workflow agents (101-112) with automatic chaining capabilities

## Execution Flow (main)

   ‚Üí [CLARIFIED]: All reference URLs point to established patterns in this repo
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer uses specialized agent for specific task type
5. Generate Functional Requirements

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT specialized behaviors agents need and WHY for development optimization
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for development team stakeholders using Guardian agents

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A development team uses the Guardian Agent system to optimize their application development workflow. Each agent has a highly specialized role that eliminates overlap and maximizes efficiency. When a developer invokes an agent for a specific task, the agent's specialization ensures optimal results and automatic chaining to the next appropriate specialist.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs strategic product planning, **When** they invoke the strategy guardian agents, **Then** the system automatically chains from high-level strategy (001) through detailed product management (002-006) to design handoff (021)

2. **Given** a developer needs to implement a feature, **When** they start with a development task, **Then** the system routes through architecture validation (041-045) before engaging appropriate development specialists (061-069) with quality assurance (071-073)

3. **Given** a security review is needed, **When** any development agent completes work, **Then** the system automatically engages security operations (092-094) followed by infrastructure deployment (081-083) specialists

4. **Given** a developer views agent documentation, **When** they read any agent file, **Then** they can immediately understand the agent's unique specialization, input requirements, output deliverables, and next-agent chaining logic

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple agents have overlapping capabilities? ‚Üí Clear specialization boundaries prevent conflicts
- How does system handle agent specialization gaps? ‚Üí Comprehensive coverage across all development lifecycle phases
- What if an agent's specialization changes over time? ‚Üí Template system allows consistent updates across all agents

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Each Guardian agent MUST have a unique specialization that distinguishes it from all other agents in the system
- **FR-002**: Agent documentation MUST clearly define input sources, processing capabilities, and output destinations with specific examples
