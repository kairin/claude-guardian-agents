# Guardian Agents â€” Roles Summary

This repository contains many individual agent role documents. Most are role descriptions and not software-specific instructions.

Purpose
- Provide concise guidance on how to use agent roles in real projects
- Point maintainers to the `CHANGELOG.md` for historical decisions
- Preserve full originals in `docs/archive/` for reference

How to use
- For day-to-day work: reference this file and the top-level `README.md`.
- For release notes and changes: check `CHANGELOG.md`.
- For full agent role text: see `docs/archive/` (role files preserved there).

Principles
- Keep documentation minimal and actionable
- Consolidate role descriptions into one-page summaries
- Use `CHANGELOG.md` for historical and behavioral changes

If you need a full role file, look under `docs/archive/` where originals are preserved.
