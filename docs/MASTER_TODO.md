# üìã Master TODO List

This document consolidates all identified tasks and action items across the project.

## üéØ Overall Project Strategy & Prioritization

This section outlines the recommended phased approach for tackling the identified issues, prioritizing core stability and foundational improvements.

### Phase 1: Core Stability & Environment Foundation (Highest Priority)
- [ ] **Objective**: Ensure the development environment is stable, reliable, and consistent, and address critical workflow blockers.
- [ ] **Tasks**:
    - [x] **Address Makefile Python Path Resolution (Issue #1)**: Fix the `Makefile` commands to reliably use the `uv`-managed Python interpreter.
    - [x] **Enforce `uv` for `pre-commit` Hook Dependencies**: Remove `additional_dependencies` from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and manage them via the main `uv`-managed virtual environment.
    - [ ] **Investigate and fix `fix end of files` / `update-progress` loop**: Resolve the persistent loop caused by these pre-commit hooks modifying `tracking/progress.json`.
    - [ ] **Address GPM Error Handling (Issue #2) & Rich Library Detection (Issue #3)**: Resolve these lower-severity issues for a cleaner system.

### Phase 2: Foundational Documentation Quality (High Priority)
- [ ] **Objective**: Establish a baseline for documentation quality and ensure existing validation tools are effective.
- [ ] **Tasks**:
    - [x] **Run `scripts/validate_docs.py`**: Execute the existing validation script to identify issues with YAML front matter and SVG embedding.
    - [ ] **Address `TODO: Add date format validation for 'last_updated'` in `scripts/validate_docs.py`**: Improve the existing validation tool.
    - [ ] **Implement Markdown Linting, Spell Checks, Link Validation**: Research, integrate, and run tools for comprehensive documentation quality.
    - [ ] **Address `mypy` code quality issues**: Resolve type hinting and code quality errors reported by `mypy` in Python scripts.

### Phase 3: Structured Documentation Enhancement (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Objective**: Systematically improve the structure and content of the documentation.
- [ ] **Tasks**:
    - [ ] **Continue Documentation Refactoring (Batch 5 & 6)**: Progress through the remaining files to conform to the standard YAML front matter format.
    - [ ] **Continue Research Documentation**: Systematically document research papers and academic foundations for each Guardian agent, adding citations and updating relevant sections.

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement & Maintenance (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Objective**: Maintain project health and ensure long-term stability.
- [ ] **Tasks**:
    - [ ] **General Testing (Regression, Integration)**: Regularly run these tests after any significant changes.
    - [ ] **Backup & Version Control**: Continue to adhere to good practices for backups and version control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment & Tooling

### Enforce uv for pre-commit Hook Dependencies

- [x] **Objective**: Ensure `uv` is the sole manager for all Python requirements, including those for `pre-commit` hooks, by removing `pip`-managed `additional_dependencies`.
- [x] **Impact**:
    - [x] Eliminates `pre-commit` environment errors.
    - [x] Unified Dependency Management.
    - [x] Improved Reproducibility.
- [x] **Phase 1: Assessment & Preparation**
    - [x] **Step 1.1: Identify Affected Hooks and Dependencies**: Review `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to pinpoint all Python-based hooks that currently use `additional_dependencies`.
    - [x] **Step 1.2: Backup Current Configuration**: Create a backup of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and any relevant dependency files.
- [x] **Phase 2: Configuration Modification**
    - [x] **Step 2.1: Remove `additional_dependencies` from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: For each identified hook, delete the `additional_dependencies` key and its associated list of packages.
    - [x] **Step 2.2: Integrate Dependencies into Main Project Requirements**: Add the identified dependencies to the project's primary dependency management file (e.g., `pyproject.toml` or ensure they are covered by `Makefile` install commands).
- [x] **Phase 3: Environment & Hook Re-initialization**
    - [x] **Step 3.1: Re-create `uv` Virtual Environment**: Perform a clean re-creation of the `uv` virtual environment (`make env-reset`).
    - [x] **Step 3.2: Re-install `pre-commit` Hooks**: Re-install `pre-commit` hooks (`pre-commit install`).
- [ ] **Phase 4: Validation & Documentation**
    - [ ] **Step 4.1: Validate `pre-commit` Hook Functionality**: Run all `pre-commit` hooks against the codebase (`make check` or `pre-commit run --all-files`).
    - [ ] **Step 4.2: Document the Change**: Update relevant project documentation (e.g., `docs/getting-started/installation.md`, `README.md`).

## ü§ñ Gemini Agent Recommendations (2025-09-14)

This section outlines recommendations from the Gemini agent for improving project structure, documentation, and overall maintainability.

### A. Version Inconsistency (Critical Correctness Issue)
- [ ] **TASK: Verify `manifest.json` version and update if necessary.**
  - **Details**: Ensure `manifest.json`'s version aligns with `pyproject.toml` (currently 3.1.0). If `scripts/generate-manifest.py` is not updating it correctly, investigate and fix the script.
  - **Priority**: Critical
- [ ] **TASK: Establish a single source of truth for project version.**
  - **Details**: Centralize the project version definition (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`) and ensure all other files (like `manifest.json`, `README.md`) either reference it or are automatically updated.
  - **Priority**: High

### B. Agent Documentation Structure (Consolidation/Correctness)
- [ ] **TASK: Standardize frontmatter across all agent Markdown files.**
  - **Details**: Implement a consistent frontmatter structure (like the one seen in Think-Tank agents) for all agent Markdown files (e.g., Product/Design agents).
  - **Priority**: High
- [ ] **TASK: Automate frontmatter generation/validation.**
  - **Details**: Develop a pre-commit hook or script to ensure all new/modified agent files adhere to the standardized frontmatter.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### C. Redundant Agent Image Links (Simplification/Correctness)
- [ ] **TASK: Consolidate agent image paths.**
  - **Details**: Choose a single, consistent method for referencing agent images (e.g., always relative to the project root's `assets` directory).
  - **Priority**: Medium
- [ ] **TASK: Update all agent Markdown files with consolidated image paths.**
  - **Details**: Modify existing agent files to use the new, consistent image referencing method. This can be automated.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### D. Research Documentation (Consolidation/Simplification)
- [ ] **TASK: Centralize or reference research documentation.**
  - **Details**: Decide whether to centralize all detailed research in `docs/RESEARCH-PAPERS.md` (with agent files linking to sections) or keep details in agent files and make `docs/RESEARCH-PAPERS.md` an index.
  - **Priority**: High
- [ ] **TASK: Remove redundant detailed research content.**
  - **Details**: Ensure no duplication of detailed research information across multiple files once a strategy is decided.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### E. UV-Only Compliance (Correctness/Simplification)
- [ ] **TASK: Audit and remove non-UV package manager references.**
  - **Details**: Go through all documentation and installation scripts to eliminate references to `pip`, `conda`, `poetry`, etc., as per the "UV-Only Violations" identified.
  - **Priority**: High
- [ ] **TASK: Automate UV-only compliance validation.**
  - **Details**: Implement a pre-commit hook or CI/CD check to automatically detect and flag non-UV references.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### F. Pre-commit Hooks (Correctness/Simplification)
- [ ] **TASK: Verify and resolve problematic pre-commit hooks.**
  - **Details**: Confirm that `end-of-file-fixer` and `update-progress` (if still present or re-introduced) are correctly configured or removed to prevent commit failures. Follow the `issues_to_fix.md` roadmap.
  - **Priority**: Critical
- [ ] **TASK: Redesign problematic hooks if necessary.**
  - **Details**: If `update-progress` or similar functionality is desired, redesign it to avoid modifying staged files or creating infinite loops.
  - **Priority**: High
