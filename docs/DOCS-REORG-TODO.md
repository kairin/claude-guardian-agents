# Documentation Reorganization Todo List

- [ ] Group agent-related docs under agents/
  - Move AGENT-CREATION-GUIDE.md and any agent mapping/registry/relationship/template docs into docs/agents/. Add or update README.md to describe the folder.
- [ ] Move system design docs to system-design/
  - Move three-tier-guardian-system.md, requirements-guardian-agent.md, and related files into docs/system-design/. Ensure README.md summarizes the folder.
- [ ] Organize validation and progress docs
  - Create docs/validation/ for IMPLEMENTATION-VALIDATION.md, IMPLEMENTATION-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md, COMPLETE-PROGRESS-DOCUMENTATION.md, DOCUMENTATION-COMPLETE.md, DRY-RUN-RESULTS.md, and similar. Add README.md to explain purpose.
- [ ] Move research docs to research/
  - Create docs/research/ and move RESEARCH-PAPERS.md and related files there. Add README.md for context.
- [ ] Consolidate getting started and installation docs
  - Ensure all onboarding docs (gpm-installation.md, installation.md, quick-start.md, USAGE_AND_WORKFLOW.md) are in docs/getting-started/. Add or update README.md.
- [ ] Organize project management and workflows
  - Move PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md, progress-tracking.md, and all workflow docs into docs/project-management/ and docs/workflows/. Add README.md to each as needed.
- [ ] Move troubleshooting and tools docs
  - Ensure common-issues.md is in docs/troubleshooting/ and script-reference.md is in docs/tools/. Add README.md if missing.
- [ ] Clean up docs root folder
  - After moving files, keep only a high-level README.md and a TOC in docs/. Remove or relocate all other files to appropriate subfolders.
