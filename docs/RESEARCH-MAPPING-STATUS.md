# 📊 Research Mapping Status Report

## 🎯 Current Situation

We need to integrate research papers from an external Claude artifact into our Guardian agents system. The artifact contains valuable research citations that can strengthen the academic foundation of our agents.

## 📋 What We Have

### ✅ Completed
1. **Research Infrastructure**
   - RESEARCH-PAPERS.md (central repository)
   - Research documentation TODO (8-phase plan)
   - Phase 2 analysis document

2. **Think-Tank Agents (101-120)**
   - Fully documented with ParaThinker research
   - 4 agents implemented with research citations
   - Design document with research foundation

3. **System Updates**
   - README.md with research section
   - CHANGELOG with research documentation
   - Research mapping framework

### ⏳ Pending - Phase 2 Agents

#### Product Management Agents (001-006) Need:
- **001**: Product Leadership - Needs strategic vision research
- **002**: Product Strategy - Needs strategy execution research  
- **003**: Product Management - Needs day-to-day PM research
- **004**: Product Ownership - Needs Agile/Scrum research
- **005**: Senior Product - Needs advanced PM research
- **006**: Associate Product - Needs junior PM research

#### Product Design Agents (021-025) Need:
- **021**: Design Leadership - Needs design strategy research
- **022**: UX Research - Needs user research methodology
- **023**: UX Junior - Needs basic UX research
- **024**: UI Interface - Needs visual design theory
- **025**: UI Junior - Needs basic UI principles

## 🔬 Research Categories to Map

From our analysis, we need research in these areas:

### Product Management Research
1. Lean Startup methodology
2. Jobs-to-be-Done framework
3. Product-Market Fit
4. Agile/Scrum principles
5. OKRs and metrics (HEART, Lean Analytics)
6. Product leadership books

### Design Research
1. Design Thinking (IDEO, Stanford)
2. UX Research Methods
3. Human-Computer Interaction (Don Norman)
4. Visual Design Theory
5. Accessibility Standards (WCAG)
6. Design Systems

### Cross-Cutting Research
1. Multi-agent systems
2. Cognitive science
3. Software engineering principles
4. Organizational theory
5. Behavioral economics

## 🎯 Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Access Research Content**: Need the Claude artifact content to be copied/pasted
2. **Extract Citations**: Pull all paper titles, authors, years, URLs
3. **Categorize Papers**: Map to agent categories
4. **Update Documentation**: Add to RESEARCH-PAPERS.md

### Implementation Plan
1. **Test with Agent 001**: Add 3-5 primary sources as pilot
2. **Create Template**: Standardize research section format
3. **Replicate**: Apply to all 11 Phase 2 agents
4. **Validate**: Ensure research aligns with agent capabilities

## 📝 Research Section Template for Agents

```markdown
## 📚 Research Foundation

### Primary Research
- **[Title]** ([Author], [Year])
  - Paper: [URL/DOI]
  - Key Concept: [Brief description]
  - Implementation: [How this agent uses it]
  - Impact: [Measured improvement]

### Supporting Research  
- **[Framework Name]** - [Specific application]
- **[Methodology]** - [Implementation approach]

### Validation Metrics
- [Evidence of effectiveness]
- [Industry adoption stats]
```

## 🔄 Mapping Strategy

Once we have the research content, we'll:

1. **Phase 2 Priority** (Product & Design):
   - Map Lean Startup → Agents 001-006
   - Map Design Thinking → Agents 021-025
   - Map HCI principles → All design agents

2. **Phase 3 Priority** (Engineering):
   - Map software architecture → Agents 041-045
   - Map development practices → Agents 061-069
   - Map DevOps research → Agents 081-083

3. **Phase 4 Priority** (Operations):
   - Map security frameworks → Agents 092-094
   - Map data governance → Agents 095-097
   - Map ITIL/service mgmt → Agents 098-100

## ⚠️ Blockers

- **Cannot access Claude artifact directly** (403 error)
- Need manual content transfer from artifact
- Research papers may need additional sourcing

## 📊 Coverage Status

| Agent Category | Total Agents | Research Added | Remaining |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Think-Tank | 20 | 4 (20%) | 16 |
| Product Mgmt | 6 | 0 (0%) | 6 |
| Product Design | 5 | 0 (0%) | 5 |
| Architecture | 5 | 0 (0%) | 5 |
| Development | 9 | 0 (0%) | 9 |
| Quality | 3 | 0 (0%) | 3 |
| DevOps | 3 | 0 (0%) | 3 |

| IT Ops | 3 | 0 (0%) | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | **60** | **4 (6.7%)** | **56** |

## 📅 Timeline Estimate

With research content provided:
- **Day 1**: Map and categorize all research
- **Day 2**: Update RESEARCH-PAPERS.md
- **Day 3**: Test with Agent 001
