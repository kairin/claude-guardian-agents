## üéØ Research Mapping Guide

### For Product Agents
- **Junior (001, 006)**: Focus on Lean Startup, Customer Development execution
- **Mid-level (002, 004)**: Add metrics (HEART), prioritization (RICE)
- **Senior (003, 005)**: Emphasize JTBD, strategic frameworks

### For Design Agents
- **Leadership (021)**: Design Thinking + business strategy
- **Research (022-023)**: User research methods, testing protocols
- **Visual (024-025)**: Gestalt principles, typography, color theory
- **All**: Include Norman's principles and Nielsen's heuristics

## üìù Template for Remaining Agents

```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Apply research to agents 002-006 (Product Management)
2. Apply research to agents 021-025 (Product Design)
3. Validate each implementation

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Complete all Phase 2 agents
2. Update agent relationships to reference shared research
3. Create cross-references between agents using same frameworks

### Documentation Updates Needed
1. Update main README with Phase 2 completion
2. Update CHANGELOG with research additions
3. Create agent-to-research mapping table
4. Document empirical validation metrics

## üìä Implementation Metrics

### Coverage Progress
- **Phase 2 Agents**: 11/11 complete (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Research Documentation**: 100% mapped
- **Template Validated**: ‚úÖ Yes
- **All agents have 3-7 research sources each**

### Quality Metrics
- **Research per Agent**: 3-7 sources
- **Citation Quality**: Peer-reviewed + industry validated
- **Modern Balance**: 80% modern, 20% foundational

## üî¨ Key Research Insights Applied

1. **Parallel Reasoning**: All senior agents get ParaThinker architecture
2. **Empirical Validation**: Each framework includes metrics
3. **Role Differentiation**: Junior focus on execution, senior on strategy
4. **Modern Enhancement**: AI-specific guidelines added to all agents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Books vs Papers**: Using books for comprehensive frameworks, papers for validation
2. **Seniority Mapping**: Junior agents get tactical research, senior get strategic
3. **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Same framework referenced consistently across agents
4. **Validation Metrics**: Including performance improvements where documented
