## ü§î Deeper Research Required

### Questions to Answer:

1. **Agent Differentiation**
   - What specific research differentiates senior vs junior agents?
   - How do leadership agents differ from execution agents in their theoretical foundation?

2. **Modern vs Classic Research**
   - Should we prioritize recent research (2020+) or foundational texts?
   - How do we balance academic rigor with industry practice?

3. **Domain-Specific Research**
   - Do we need industry-specific research (B2B vs B2C, SaaS vs hardware)?
   - Should we include platform-specific research (mobile, web, IoT)?

4. **Cognitive Science Integration**
   - How deep into psychology/neuroscience should we go?
   - Should we include behavioral economics (Kahneman, Thaler)?

5. **Measurement & Validation**
   - What research supports agent effectiveness measurement?
   - How do we validate that agents follow research principles?

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Core Foundation (Do First)
1. **Lean Startup** - Covers 001-003 (strategy/management)
2. **Design Thinking** (IDEO) - Covers 021-022 (design leadership/UX)
3. **Don Norman's principles** - Covers 022-025 (all design agents)
4. **Agile/Scrum** - Covers 004-006 (ownership/management)

### Step 2: Specialization (Layer On)
1. **JTBD Framework** - For strategy agents (001-003)
2. **UX Research Methods** - For research agents (022-023)
3. **Visual Design Theory** - For UI agents (024-025)
4. **Product Leadership** - For leadership agents (001, 021)

### Step 3: Modern Updates
1. **Continuous Discovery** - Modern product practice
2. **Design Systems** - Modern design practice
3. **Data-Driven Design** - Analytics integration
4. **AI/ML in Product** - Emerging practices

## üìö Priority Research Papers to Find

### High Priority (Week 1)
1. "The Lean Startup" - Eric Ries (2011)
2. "Design Thinking" - Tim Brown, HBR (2008)
3. "The Design of Everyday Things" - Don Norman (2013 revised)
4. "Agile Manifesto" (2001) + Scrum Guide

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
1. "Jobs to be Done" - Christensen et al. (2016)
2. "HEART: A Framework for Measuring UX" - Google (2016)
3. "Design Sprint" - Knapp et al. (2016)
4. "Continuous Discovery Habits" - Torres (2021)

### Lower Priority (Week 3+)
1. Industry-specific case studies
2. Platform-specific guidelines
3. Emerging methodologies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges

1. **Research Availability**
   - Some key texts are books, not papers (harder to cite/link)
   - Industry practices may lack academic validation

2. **Agent Scope**
   - Agents have broad responsibilities that span multiple research areas
   - Junior vs senior differentiation may be experiential, not theoretical

3. **Rapid Evolution**
   - Product/design practices evolve faster than academic research
   - Need to balance timeless principles with current practice

## üéØ Recommendation

**Before proceeding with Phase 2**, we should:

1. **Define Research Depth**: Decide how deep into each research area we go
2. **Prioritize Sources**: Focus on 3-5 key papers per agent category
3. **Create Templates**: Standardize how research is added to agent files
4. **Test with One Agent**: Complete 001 fully before doing all others

## üìù Proposed Research Addition Template

```markdown
## üìö Research Foundation

### Primary Research
- **[Paper/Book Title]** (Author, Year)
  - Key Concept: [Brief description]
  - Application: [How this agent uses it]
  - Validation: [Metrics/evidence]

### Supporting Research
- **[Secondary Source]** - [Specific concept used]
- **[Framework]** - [Implementation approach]

### Empirical Evidence
- [Study/metric showing effectiveness]
- [Industry adoption statistics]
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Approve research depth and scope**
2. **Gather primary sources (papers, books)**
3. **Create research summaries for each source**
4. **Map research to specific agent capabilities**
5. **Update agent files with citations**
6. **Validate implementation against research**
