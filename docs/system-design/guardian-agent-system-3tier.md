I'll create a three-tier agent system to prevent these recurring issues. Each model has a specific role in the prevention pipeline.I've created a comprehensive **Three-Tier Guardian Agent System** that uses model specialization to prevent your recurring issues:

## System Architecture:

### üéØ **Haiku Agent** ($0.25/1M tokens) - The Fixer
- **Role**: Execute fixes from todo list
- **Rules**: Fix EXACTLY what's listed, add NOTHING else
- **Output**: Completed fixes without any "helpful" additions

### üîç **Sonnet Agent** ($3/1M tokens) - The Analyzer
- **Role**: Scan entire codebase for problems
- **Output**: `issues_to_fix.md` with atomic, specific todos
- **Specialization**: Detects hook loops, automation creep, over-engineering

### üëë **Opus Agent** ($15/1M tokens) - The Orchestrator
- **Role**: Review changes and orchestrate the other agents
- **Power**: Reject ANY unrequested features
- **Delegation**: Uses Sonnet for analysis, Haiku for fixes

## How It Prevents Your Issues:

1. **Pre-commit Hook Loops**:
   - Sonnet detects: "Hooks modifying files that trigger other hooks"
   - Generates todo: "Remove update-progress hook from .pre-commit-config.yaml"
   - Haiku executes: Deletes hook, nothing more

2. **Unrequested Features**:
   - Opus reviews: "Is this in original requirements?"
   - If NO ‚Üí Immediate rejection
   - No "helpful" additions ever reach implementation

3. **Over-Engineering**:
   - Sonnet identifies: "Complex solution for simple problem"
   - Creates todo: "Replace [complex] with [simple]"
   - Haiku implements: Simplest possible fix

## Workflow Example:

```yaml
Your Request: "Fix pre-commit hooks"
‚Üì
Opus: "Requirements = Make commits work, nothing else"
‚Üì
Sonnet: Scans and finds update-progress hook loop
        Outputs: "Remove update-progress hook"
‚Üì
Haiku: Deletes hook, commits, stops
‚Üì
Opus: Verifies no extras added ‚Üí APPROVED
```

## Cost Efficiency:
- **Total monthly cost**: ~$1.20 for 100 commits
- **Time saved**: Hours of debugging complexity
- **ROI**: Immediate

The key innovation: **Expensive thinking, cheap doing**. Opus only makes decisions, Sonnet only analyzes, and Haiku only executes. No model exceeds its role, preventing the scope creep that wasted your time.

This system would have caught and prevented your pre-commit hook issue at the design phase - Opus would have rejected it as "unrequested automation" before it was ever implemented.
