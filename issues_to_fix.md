## CI/CD Implementation

### Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline (Zero Cost)
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` for automated builds, tests, linting, and manifest generation.
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules for `main` to enforce passing CI checks and required reviews.

### Create CI/CD Agent Group
- [ ] Define a new agent category for "CI/CD Agents" or "DevOps Agents".
- [ ] Create specialized agents within this group (e.g., `ci-workflow-guardian`, `deployment-guardian`, `pipeline-monitor-guardian`).
