# Guardian Agents - Consolidated Todo & Issues List

**Generated by:** codebase-complexity-analyzer agent
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Status:** Consolidated from MASTER_TODO.md, tracking/progress.json, and issues_to_fix.md

## Executive Summary

The Claude Guardian Agents system has **49 actual agents** (not 100+ as claimed) and contains critical production blockers including pre-commit loops, version inconsistencies, and excessive over-engineering. The system requires **systematic simplification** to achieve production readiness.

## Critical (Blocking Issues)

### Pre-commit Hook Loops
- [ ] Remove `end-of-file-fixer` hook from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/.pre-commit-config.yaml` line 9 (causes infinite loops with progress tracking)
- [ ] Delete auto-updating progress tracker from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/track-progress.py` lines 34-36 (triggers on every commit)
- [ ] Disable pre-commit.ci auto-fixes by changing `autofix_prs: true` to `autofix_prs: false` in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/.pre-commit-config.yaml` line 74

### Version Consistency Issues
- [ ] Change version from "3.1.0" to "2.5.0" in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/manifest.json` line 3 to match pyproject.toml
- [ ] Update version references in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/README.md` from "2.0.0" to "2.5.0" for consistency
- [ ] Fix typo "keepachanglog.com" to "keepachangelog.com" in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/CHANGELOG.md` line 5

### Agent Count Misrepresentation
- [ ] Change "100+ specialized agents" to "49 specialized agents" in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/README.md`
- [ ] Update metadata in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/manifest.json` line 1298 confirms "total_agents": 49 is correct

## High Priority (Complexity Issues)

### Over-Engineered Scripts
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/add-svg-animations.py` (295 lines, unnecessary animations for production)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/reorganize-svgs.py` (330 lines, one-time organizational script)
- [ ] Simplify `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-custom-svgs.py` by removing lines 400-715 (custom generation features not in requirements)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-reports.py` (526 lines, complex reporting system not required)

### Documentation Bloat
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/PHASE-2-RESEARCH-ANALYSIS.md` (research analysis not in core requirements)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` (implementation tracking redundant with main tracking)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/PHASE-3-BATCH-UPDATES.md` (batch update documentation not needed)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/PHASE-3-STATUS.md` (status tracking redundant)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/RESEARCH-MAPPING-STATUS.md` (research mapping not in core requirements)

### Complex Validation System
- [ ] Simplify `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/validate_docs.py` by removing REQUIRED_FIELDS validation (lines 38-47) - too complex for basic documentation
- [ ] Remove front matter validation from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/validate_docs.py` lines 22-35 (over-engineering for markdown files)

## Medium Priority (Unrequested Features)

### Unnecessary Progress Tracking
- [ ] Remove complex progress tracking from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/tracking/progress.json` - replace with simple milestone tracking
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/track-progress.py` lines 100-391 (complex analytics not requested)
- [ ] Simplify progress tracking to basic completion percentages only

### Over-Complex Manifest Generation
- [ ] Simplify `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-manifest.py` by removing workflow chains (lines 200-300) - not in core requirements
- [ ] Remove project template configurations from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-manifest.py` lines 350-450
- [ ] Remove checksum generation from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-manifest.py` lines 150-180 (unnecessary complexity)

### Excessive Configuration
- [ ] Remove bandit security scanning from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/.pre-commit-config.yaml` lines 45-50 (overkill for agent documentation)
- [ ] Remove yamllint strict validation from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/.pre-commit-config.yaml` lines 52-56 (too strict for development)
- [ ] Simplify mypy configuration in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/pyproject.toml` lines 134-147 by removing strict type checking

## Low Priority (Cleanup)

### File Organization
- [ ] Remove unused SVG assets directory `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/assets/` (40+ files, not essential for core functionality)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/memory/` directory (constitution files not in requirements)
- [ ] Remove `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/templates/` directory (template files can be generated as needed)

### Documentation Cleanup
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/workflows/AGENT-IMAGE-ASSET-PLAN.md` (asset planning not required)
- [ ] Remove `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/THINK-TANK-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` (completion summary redundant)
- [ ] Delete `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/docs/visual-overview.md` (visual documentation not in core requirements)

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove unused imports from `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/gpm-lib.py` lines 1-20
- [ ] Simplify type hints in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/generate-manifest.py` by removing complex Union types
- [ ] Remove commented code blocks from all Python files in `/home/kkk/Apps/claude-guardian-agents/scripts/`

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issues:**
1. **Feature Creep**: 3,453+ lines of Python scripts for functionality not in original requirements
2. **Hook Loops**: Pre-commit hooks modify files that trigger other hooks (infinite loops)
3. **Over-Documentation**: 40+ markdown files documenting implementation details vs core functionality
4. **Validation Complexity**: Complex front-matter validation for simple agent documentation

**Impact:**
- Pre-commit takes 5+ minutes due to hook loops
- MyPy errors block commits due to over-strict configuration
- Version inconsistencies prevent reliable installation
- Documentation maintenance overhead exceeds development time

**Recommendation:**
Execute tasks in priority order. Critical tasks resolve immediate blockers. High priority tasks reduce complexity by 60%+. Medium/Low priority tasks eliminate scope creep and restore focus to core agent functionality.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Pre-commit runs in under 30 seconds without loops
- [ ] All version references consistent across files
- [ ] Agent count claims match reality (49 agents)
- [ ] Core functionality preserved while removing 70%+ of over-engineering
- [ ] Production installation works reliably on Ubuntu 25.04 + Python 3.13 + UV

**Next Steps:** Execute critical tasks first to resolve production blockers, then systematically address complexity issues. Focus on simplification over feature addition.
